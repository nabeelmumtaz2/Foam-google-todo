It works at development as well as runtime and scales from embedded devices to large, distributed clusters. Web applications implementing modularity at runtime provide interesting capabilities to adapt quickly to customer needs and dynamic environments.</p>\n<p>But there is no out-of-the-box infrastructure. Few containers provide OSGi support, which is not always complete. Very often, developers start with an OSGi framework by themselves and add technology individually, which results into additional maintenance effort going forward.</p>\n<p>The open source Eclipse Gyrex Project addresses this problem by providing an infrastructure for building OSGi clusters. It combines successful Eclipse RT technologies such as the Equinox OSGi framework, p2 and Jetty with standards such as JAX-RS, dependency injection and web sockets allowing seamless and pain-free creation and operation of clustered OSGi applications.</p>\n<p>In this session we\u2019ll present a technology stack based on Eclipse Gyrex that can be used for building scalable and modular web applications. We\u2019ll start with an overview and continue with a deep dive through the stack using a sample application. You will also learn about typical cluster deployments for web applications and batch processing, understanding the development workflow and best practices.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll also show you how HTML5 and JavaScript based frontends can be developed and deployment alongside the backend supporting its modularity.</p>"

That&#39;s how WebAR was born, an open source project which does Augmented Reality using web standards. We were wondering how far we could push the technology...the good news is that we can go pretty far!</p>\n<p>First, we succeeded on making AR run in a browser. We were already quite happy with this, but then we went for the moon and wanted to run that on mobile phones too. And it turns out it actually works! Imagine that: Being able to provide free AR for everybody to use in their everyday life with their mobile devices!</p>\n<p>WebAR shows us how to get Augmented Reality using only web technologies. It is an open source threex extension for three.js. It captures the video with webrtc, localizes the AR markers using artoolkit,<br>\nand displays the 3d on top of your reality with three.js.</p>\n<p>I will tell you everything you need to know to write your own Augmented Reality application!

All that for a quick-and-simple in-browser screen with a few buttons and some text.</p>\n<p>Even using Yeoman or prebuilt seed projects is annoying - because the core frontend frameworks are geared towards production and stability, not fast iteration of prototyping work. And dropping down to basic jQuery loses a lot of the productivity gains of richer toolsets.</p>\n<p>BARC (a tongue-in-cheek term!) is a set of simple NPM modules that streamline all that drudgery. Skip boilerplate CSS cruft with Boxbits, use Atomic Routes for easy back-button support, and Remote Control to bypass fiddling with Express POST routes and just call your server JS functions from the browser. UI rendering is driven by vdom-live - a tiny module that leverages virtual DOM to rapidly set up reactive frontend code.</p>\n<p>This is a radical departure from the typical legacy Web stack, but it is geared towards maximum prototyping speed without worrying about stylesheets, AJAX or manually updating view widgets. Don&#39;t try this in production (yet)!&quot;</p>"

Functional programming is a programming paradigm\u2014a style of building the structure and elements of an application. Languages such as Scala, Swift, and Haskell are great examples of functional languages. Multi-dimensional languages such as JavaScript have the capabilities to solve complex problems with the power of abstraction. Functional JavaScript provides you with the tools to better organize, debug, and test your code. It allows these things by constructing operations into reusable and composable building blocks. We will show you tips on how to reduce complexity in your application by employing functional practices such as monads, currying, high-order functions, map, reduce, and filter.</p>"

Automated testing is normally a foreign concept in the Operations world, but as you ssh into your servers to make that quick fix or run your updated script (fingers crossed), you might be wondering if there&#39;s a better way. A way that gives you the confidence in your script and lets you test those scripts in isolation. Well I have good news for you, there is a better way! Test Driven Infrastructure (TDI) is now possible. I know, it sounds crazy.</p>\n<p>At this session you&#39;ll learn the how, and more importantly the why, of TDI. You&#39;ll see how Chef (or any other Config Management framework) can be tested with Test Kitchen and ServerSpec. You&#39;ll also learn how to improve your feedback cycle with Docker, and using the Docker approach on a CI server. There may even be some live demos!</p>\n<p>Finally, the Ops world collides with the Dev world in true DevOps testing bliss.</p>"
