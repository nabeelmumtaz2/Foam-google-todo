This demo shows FOAM's ability to perform high-performance reciprocal search, and it's ability to transparently work with either local or remote data-sources (DAO's).

Controller.js contains a standalone model that stores data locally. It can be run at from GitHub at [http://foam-framework.github.io/foam/foam/index.html?model=foam.demos.olympics.Controller](http://foam-framework.github.io/foam/foam/index.html?model=foam.demos.olympics.Controller).

ClientController.js contains a Client version which connects to the server supplied in Server.js.

From the top level foam directory, run the server with:

    node --harmony tools/foam.js foam.node.Server agents=foam.demos.olympics.Server

Then run the client by connecting to [http://localhost:8000/index.html?model=foam.demos.olympics.ClientController](http://localhost:8000/index.html?model=foam.demos.olympics.ClientController)
